## FAQ

**Q: Is the CRS score accurate?**
A: Yes, we use the official IRCC Comprehensive Ranking System formula, updated for 2024-2025.

**Q: Do I need a job offer for Express Entry?**
A: Not necessarily. While it adds 50-200 points, many candidates receive invitations based on high human capital scores or provincial nominations.

**Q: How do I improve my score if it's too low?**
A: Look at the **Recommendations** section in your dashboard. Improving language scores or gaining 1 year of Canadian experience are the most common boosters.
